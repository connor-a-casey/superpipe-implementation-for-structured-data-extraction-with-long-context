His work has influenced sociology, critical theory, post-\\ncolonial theory, and literary studies, and continues to do so. He was awarded\\nthe 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature despite attempting to refuse it, saying\\nthat he always declined official honors and that \\\"a writer should not allow\\nhimself to be turned into an institution.\\\"[5]\\n\\nSartre held an open relationship with prominent feminist and fellow\\nexistentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. Together, Sartre and de\\nBeauvoir challenged the cultural and social assumptions and expectations of\\ntheir upbringings, which they considered bourgeois, in both lifestyles and\\nthought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive conformity\\n(_mauvaise foi_ , literally, 'bad faith') and an \\\"authentic\\\" way of \\\"being\\\"\\nbecame the dominant theme of Sartre's early work, a theme embodied in his\\nprincipal philosophical work _Being and Nothingness_ (_L'\\u00catre et le N\\u00e9ant_ ,\\n1943).[6] Sartre's introduction to his philosophy is his work _Existentialism\\nIs a Humanism_ (_L'existentialisme est un humanisme_ , 1946), originally\\npresented as a lecture.\\n\\n## Biography[edit]\\n\\n### Early life[edit]\\n\\nJean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in Paris as the only child of Jean-\\nBaptiste Sartre, an officer of the French Navy, and Anne-Marie\\n(Schweitzer).[7] When Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness,\\nwhich he most likely contracted in Indochina. Anne-Marie moved back to her\\nparents' house in Meudon, where she raised Sartre with help from her father\\nCharles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and\\nintroduced him to classical literature at a very early age.[8] When he was\\ntwelve, Sartre's mother remarried, and the family moved to La Rochelle, where\\nhe was frequently bullied, in part due to the wandering of his blind right eye\\n(sensory exotropia).[9]\\n\\nAs a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading\\nHenri Bergson's essay _Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of\\nConsciousness_.[10] He attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school in\\nParis.[11] He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of\\nphilosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as\\nwell as his _dipl\\u00f4me d'\\u00e9tudes sup\\u00e9rieures [fr]_ (roughly equivalent to an MA\\nthesis) in Paris at the \\u00c9cole Normale Sup\\u00e9rieure (ENS), an institution of\\nhigher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers\\nand intellectuals.[12] (His 1928 MA thesis under the title \\\"L'Image dans la\\nvie psychologique: r\\u00f4le et nature\\\" [\\\"Image in Psychological Life: Role and\\nNature\\\"] was supervised by Henri Delacroix.)[12] It was at ENS that Sartre\\nbegan his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with Raymond Aron.[13]\\nPerhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre's philosophical development was\\nhis weekly attendance at Alexandre Koj\\u00e8ve's seminars, which continued for a\\nnumber of years.[14]\\n\\nFrom his first years in the \\u00c9cole normale, Sartre was one of its fiercest\\npranksters.[15][16] In 1927, his antimilitarist satirical cartoon in the revue\\nof the school, coauthored with Georges Canguilhem, particularly upset the\\ndirector Gustave Lanson.[17] In the same year, with his comrades Nizan,\\nLarroutis, Baillou and Herland,[18] he organized a media prank following\\nCharles Lindbergh's successful New York City\\u2013Paris flight; Sartre & Co. called\\nnewspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an\\nhonorary \\u00c9cole degree. Many newspapers, including _Le Petit Parisien_ ,\\nannounced the event on 25 May. Thousands, including journalists and curious\\nspectators, showed up, unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt\\ninvolving a Lindbergh look-alike.[17][19][20] The scandal led Lanson to\\nresign.[17]\\n\\nIn 1929 at the \\u00c9cole normale, he met Simone de Beauvoir, who studied at the\\nSorbonne and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and\\nfeminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a\\nromantic relationship,[21] though they were not monogamous.[22] The first time\\nSartre took the agr\\u00e9gation, he failed. He took it a second time and virtually\\ntied for first place with Beauvoir, although Sartre was eventually awarded\\nfirst place, with Beauvoir second.[23][24]\\n\\nFrom 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various lyc\\u00e9es of Le Havre (at the\\nLyc\\u00e9e de Le Havre, the present-day Lyc\\u00e9e Fran\\u00e7ois-Ier (Le Havre) [fr],\\n1931\\u20131936), Laon (at the Lyc\\u00e9e de Laon, 1936\\u201337), and, finally, Paris (at the\\nLyc\\u00e9e Pasteur, 1937\\u20131939, and at the Lyc\\u00e9e Condorcet, 1941\\u20131944;[25] see\\nbelow).\\n\\nIn 1932, Sartre read _Voyage au bout de la nuit_ by Louis-Ferdinand C\\u00e9line, a\\nbook that had a remarkable influence on him.[26]\\n\\nIn 1933\\u201334, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the Institut fran\\u00e7ais d'Allemagne in\\nBerlin where he studied Edmund Husserl's phenomenological philosophy. Aron had\\nalready advised him in 1930 to read Emmanuel Levinas's _Th\\u00e9orie de l'intuition\\ndans la ph\\u00e9nom\\u00e9nologie de Husserl_ (_The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's\\nPhenomenology_).[27]\\n\\nThe neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Koj\\u00e8ve and Jean Hyppolite in the\\n1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to\\ndiscover Hegel's _Phenomenology of Spirit_.[28]\\n\\n### World War II[edit]\\n\\nIn 1939, Sartre was drafted into the French Army, where he served as a\\nmeteorologist.[29][30] He was captured by German troops in 1940 in Padoux,[31]\\nand he spent nine months as a prisoner of war\\u2014in Nancy and finally in Stalag\\nXII-D [fr], Trier, where he wrote his first theatrical piece, _Barion\\u00e0, fils\\ndu tonnerre_ , a drama concerning Christmas. It was during this period of\\nconfinement that Sartre read Martin Heidegger's _Sein und Zeit_ , later to\\nbecome a major influence on his own essay on phenomenological ontology.\\nBecause of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and exotropia\\naffected his balance), Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other\\nsources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist.[32] Given\\ncivilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lyc\\u00e9e Pasteur near\\nParis and settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941, he was given a\\nposition, previously held by a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach\\nby Vichy law, at Lyc\\u00e9e Condorcet in Paris.\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Le_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral_George_C._Marshall_de_visite_de_journalistes.jpg/220px-\\nLe_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral_George_C._Marshall_de_visite_de_journalistes.jpg)Sartre\\n(third from left) and other French journalists visit General George C.\\nMarshall in the Pentagon, 1945\\n\\nAfter coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the\\nunderground group _Socialisme et Libert\\u00e9_ (\\\"Socialism and Liberty\\\") with other\\nwriters Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Toussaint Desanti,\\nDominique Desanti, Jean Kanapa, and \\u00c9cole Normale students. In spring of 1941,\\nSartre suggested with \\\"cheerful ferocity\\\" at a meeting that the _Socialisme et\\nLibert\\u00e9_ assassinate prominent war collaborators like Marcel D\\u00e9at, but de\\nBeauvoir noted his idea was rejected as \\\"none of us felt qualified to make\\nbombs or hurl grenades\\\".[33] The British historian Ian Ousby observed that the\\nFrench always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the\\nGermans, noting it was French people like D\\u00e9at that Sartre wanted to\\nassassinate rather than the military governor of France, General Otto von\\nSt\\u00fclpnagel, and the popular slogan always was \\\"Death to Laval!\\\" rather than\\n\\\"Death to Hitler!\\\".[34] In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French\\nRiviera seeking the support of Andr\\u00e9 Gide and Andr\\u00e9 Malraux. However, both\\nGide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's\\ndisappointment and discouragement. _Socialisme et libert\\u00e9_ soon dissolved and\\nSartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He\\nthen wrote _Being and Nothingness_ , _The Flies_ , and _No Exit_ , none of\\nwhich were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and\\nillegal literary magazines.\\n\\nIn his essay \\\"Paris under the Occupation\\\", Sartre wrote that the \\\"correct\\\"\\nbehaviour of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with\\nthe occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural:\\n\\n> The Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did\\n> not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer\\n> seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children\\n> and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and\\n> being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some\\n> of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical\\n> expression.[35]\\n\\nSartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-\\naccented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as\\nthey tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark \\\"We\\ncould not be _natural_ \\\".[36] French was a language widely taught in German\\nschools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself\\nalways found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions,\\nusually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but\\nstill felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he\\nhad been complicit in the Occupation.[37] Ousby wrote: \\\"But, in however humble\\na fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life\\nin a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a\\nGerman soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions\\nwere not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were\\nemblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily\\nlife\\\".[37] Sartre wrote the very \\\"correctness\\\" of the Germans caused moral\\ncorruption in many people who used the \\\"correct\\\" behavior of the Germans as an\\nexcuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-\\nday existence without challenging the occupation aided the \\\"New Order in\\nEurope\\\", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish\\nits goals.[35]\\n\\nThroughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France, and food\\nshortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French\\ncountryside went to Germany.[38] Sartre wrote about the \\\"languid existence\\\" of\\nthe Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of\\ntrucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing:\\n\\\"Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off\\nfrom the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive,\\nthe town led a purely abstract and symbolic life\\\".[38] Sartre himself lived on\\na diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvoir living in Anjou.[39]\\nThe rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay, full of maggots, and\\ndespite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it\\nhad more maggots in it than meat.[39] Sartre also remarked that conversations\\nat the Caf\\u00e9 de Flore between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one\\nof them might be a _mouche_ (informer) or a writer of the _corbeau_ (anonymous\\ndenunciatory letters) meant that no one really said what they meant anymore,\\nimposing self-censorship.[40] Sartre and his friends at the Caf\\u00e9 de Flore had\\nreasons for their fear; by September 1940, the _Abwehr_ alone had already\\nrecruited 32,000 French people to work as _mouches_ while by 1942 the Paris\\n_Kommandantur_ was receiving an average of 1,500 letters per day sent by the\\n_corbeaux_.[41]\\n\\nSartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a \\\"sham\\\", resembling the\\nempty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been\\nexported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had\\nmade Paris special was gone.[42] Paris had almost no cars on the streets\\nduring the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a\\nnightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris \\\"was peopled by the\\nabsent\\\".[43] Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the\\noccupation, writing:\\n\\n> One day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in\\n> an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would\\n> answer it. If the _concierge_ forced the door, you would find two chairs\\n> standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes\\n> on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had\\n> vanished had been present at his arrest, she would tell you that he had been\\n> taken away by very polite Germans, like those who asked the way in the\\n> street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in\\n> the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and\\n> sent away with comforting words\\\" [No. 11 Rue des Saussaies was the\\n> headquarters of the Gestapo in Paris].[44]\\n\\nSartre wrote the _feldgrau_ (\\\"field grey\\\") uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the\\ngreen uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had\\nbecome accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called \\\"a\\npale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find\\namong the dark clothes of the civilians\\\".[45] Under the occupation, the French\\noften called the Germans _les autres_ (\\\"the others\\\"), which inspired Sartre's\\naphorism in his play _Huis clos_ (\\\"No Exit\\\") of \\\"_l'enfer, c'est les Autres_ \\\"\\n(\\\"Hell is other people\\\").[46] Sartre intended the line \\\"_l'enfer, c'est les\\nAutres_ \\\" at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.[46]\\n\\nSartre was a very active contributor to _Combat_ , a newspaper created during\\nthe clandestine period by Albert Camus, a philosopher and author who held\\nsimilar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until\\n1951, with the publication of Camus's _The Rebel_. Sartre wrote extensively\\npost-war about neglected minority groups, namely French Jews and black people.\\nIn 1946, he published _Anti-Semite and Jew,_ after having published the first\\npart of the essay, \\\"Portrait de l'antis\\u00e9mite\\\", the year before in _Les Temps\\nmodernes, No. 3._ In the essay, in the course of explaining the etiology of\\n\\\"hate\\\" as the hater's projective fantasies when reflecting on the Jewish\\nquestion, he attacks antisemitism in France[47] during a time when the Jews\\nwho came back from concentration camps were quickly abandoned.[48] In 1947,\\nSartre published several articles concerning the condition of African\\nAmericans in the United States\\u2014specifically the racism and discrimination\\nagainst them in the country\\u2014in his second _Situations_ collection. Then, in\\n1948, for the introduction of L\\u00e9opold S\\u00e9dar Senghor's _l'Anthologie de la\\nnouvelle po\\u00e9sie n\\u00e8gre et malgache (Anthology of New Negro and Malagasy\\nPoetry)_ , he wrote \\\"Black Orpheus\\\" (re-published in _Situations III),_ a\\ncritique of colonialism and racism in light of the philosophy Sartre developed\\nin _Being and Nothingness._ Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as\\na resistant, the French philosopher and resistant Vladimir Jankelevitch\\ncriticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation,\\nand interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem\\nhimself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister\\nwho wrote.\\n\\nIn 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the rue\\nBonaparte, where he was to produce most of his subsequent work and where he\\nlived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly\\nliterary and political review, _Les Temps modernes_ (_Modern Times_), in part\\nto popularize his thought.[49] He ceased teaching and devoted his time to\\nwriting and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his\\ngreat trilogy of novels, _Les Chemins de la Libert\\u00e9_ (_The Roads to Freedom_)\\n(1945\\u20131949).\\n\\n### Cold War politics and anticolonialism[edit]\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Beauvoir_Sartre_-\\n_Che_Guevara_-1960_-_Cuba.jpg/220px-Beauvoir_Sartre_-\\n_Che_Guevara_-1960_-_Cuba.jpg)Jean-Paul Sartre (middle) and Simone de Beauvoir\\n(left) meeting with Che Guevara (right) in Cuba, 1960\\n\\nThe first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by _Being and\\nNothingness_ (1943), gave way to a second period\\u2014when the world was perceived\\nas split into communist and capitalist blocs\\u2014of highly publicized political\\ninvolvement. Sartre tended to glorify the Resistance after the war as the\\nuncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the\\n_r\\u00e9sistants_ were a \\\"band of brothers\\\" who had enjoyed \\\"real freedom\\\" in a way\\nthat did not exist before nor after the war.[50] Sartre was \\\"merciless\\\" in\\nattacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German\\noccupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the\\ncollaborationist writer Robert Brasillach from being executed.[50] His 1948\\nplay _Les mains sales_ (_Dirty Hands_) in particular explored the problem of\\nbeing a politically \\\"engaged\\\" intellectual. He embraced Marxism but did not\\njoin the Communist Party. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described\\nFrench nationalism as \\\"provincial\\\" and in a 1949 essay called for a \\\"United\\nStates of Europe\\\".[51] In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the\\njournal _Politique \\u00e9trang\\u00e8re_ , Sartre wrote:\\n\\n> If we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the\\n> framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that\\n> civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France,\\n> in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria,\\n> everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this\\n> cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends\\n> Europe's cultural autonomy vis-\\u00e0-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also\\n> its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single\\n> force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which\\n> will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism\\n> and Russian scientificism.[52]\\n\\nAbout the Korean War, Sartre wrote: \\\"I have no doubt that the South Korean\\nfeudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not\\ndoubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans\\\".[53] In July 1950, Sartre\\nwrote in _Les Temps Modernes_ about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the\\nSoviet Union:\\n\\n> As we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed\\n> sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were\\n> free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system,\\n> provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.[54]\\n\\nSartre held that the Soviet Union was a \\\"revolutionary\\\" state working for the\\nbetterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to\\nits own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state\\nneeded to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that\\nthe failures of \\\"bourgeois\\\" states were due to their innate shortcomings.[50]\\nThe Swiss journalist Fran\\u00e7ois Bondy wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's\\nnumerous essays, speeches and interviews \\\"a simple basic pattern never fails\\nto emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary\\\" and the\\nparties that promote the revolutionary charges \\\"may be criticized, but only by\\nthose who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and\\nits road to power\\\", deeming Sartre's position to be \\\"existentialist\\\".[50]\\n\\nSartre believed at this time in the moral superiority of the Eastern Bloc,\\narguing that this belief was necessary \\\"to keep hope alive\\\"[55] and opposed\\nany criticism of Soviet Union[56] to the extent that Maurice Merleau-Ponty\\ncalled him an \\\"ultra-Bolshevik\\\".[57] Sartre's expression \\\"workers of\\nBillancourt must not be deprived of their hopes\\\"[57] (Fr. \\\"il ne faut pas\\nd\\u00e9sesp\\u00e9rer Billancourt\\\"), became a catchphrase meaning communist activists\\nshould not tell the whole truth to the workers in order to avoid decline in\\ntheir revolutionary enthusiasm.[58]\\n\\nIn 1954, just after Stalin's death, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he\\nstated he found a \\\"complete freedom of criticism\\\" while condemning the United\\nStates for sinking into \\\"prefascism\\\".[59] Sartre wrote about those Soviet\\nwriters expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union \\\"still had the opportunity of\\nrehabilitating themselves by writing better books\\\".[60] Sartre's comments on\\nHungarian revolution of 1956 are quite representative to his frequently\\ncontradictory and changing views. On one hand, Sartre saw in Hungary a true\\nreunification between intellectuals and workers[61] only to criticize it for\\n\\\"losing socialist base\\\".[62]\\n\\nIn 1964 Sartre attacked Khrushchev's \\\"Secret Speech\\\" which condemned the\\nStalinist repressions and purges. Sartre argued that \\\"the masses were not\\nready to receive the truth\\\".[63]\\n\\nIn 1969 Sartre, along with other fifteen prominent French writers, including\\nLouis Aragon and Michel Butor, signed the letter of protest against the\\nexpulsion of \\\"the writer most representative of the great Russian tradition,\\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn \\\\- already a victim of Stalinist repression\\\", from the\\nUnion of Soviet Writers.[64][65]\\n\\nIn 1973 he argued that \\\"revolutionary authority always needs to get rid of\\nsome people that threaten it, and their death is the only way\\\".[66] A number\\nof people, starting from Frank Gibney in 1961, classified Sartre as a \\\"useful\\nidiot\\\" due to his uncritical position.[67]\\n\\nSartre came to admire the Polish leader W\\u0142adys\\u0142aw Gomu\\u0142ka, a man who favored a\\n\\\"Polish road to socialism\\\" and wanted more independence for Poland, but was\\nloyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue.[68] Sartre's\\nnewspaper _Les Temps Modernes_ devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and\\n1958 to Poland under Gomu\\u0142ka, praising him for his reforms.[68] Bondy wrote of\\nthe notable contradiction between Sartre's \\\"ultra Bolshevism\\\" as he expressed\\nadmiration for the Chinese leader Mao Zedong as the man who led the oppressed\\nmasses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate\\nCommunist leaders like Gomu\\u0142ka.[68]\\n\\nAs an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against\\nFrench rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the\\nFrench in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the FLN in the Algerian\\nWar and was one of the signatories of the _Manifeste des 121_. Consequently,\\nSartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary Organisation arm\\u00e9e secr\\u00e8te\\n(OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early '60s.[69] He later argued in\\n1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during\\nthe Algerian War of Independence.[70] (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette\\nElka\\u00efm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement\\nin the Vietnam War and, along with Bertrand Russell and others, organized a\\ntribunal intended to expose U.S. war crimes, which became known as the Russell\\nTribunal in 1967.\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Jean_Paul_Sartre_by_Gray.jpg/180px-\\nJean_Paul_Sartre_by_Gray.jpg)Sketch of Sartre for _The New York Times_ by\\nReginald Gray, 1965\\n\\nHis work after Stalin's death, the _Critique de la raison dialectique_\\n(_Critique of Dialectical Reason_), appeared in 1960 (a second volume\\nappearing posthumously). In the _Critique_ Sartre set out to give Marxism a\\nmore vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended\\nby concluding that Marx's notion of \\\"class\\\" as an objective entity was\\nfallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of\\nMarx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the\\n1960s, Louis Althusser, who claimed that the ideas of the young Marx were\\ndecisively superseded by the \\\"scientific\\\" system of the later Marx. In the\\nlate 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too\\napolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by\\nFrantz Fanon started to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third\\nWorld, the \\\"real damned of the earth\\\", who would carry out the revolution.[71]\\nA major theme of Sartre's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust\\nwith the \\\"Americanization\\\" of the French working class who would much rather\\nwatch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.[50]\\n\\nSartre went to Cuba in the 1960s to meet Fidel Castro and spoke with Ernesto\\n\\\"Che\\\" Guevara. After Guevara's death, Sartre would declare him to be \\\"not only\\nan intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\\\"[72] and the\\n\\\"era's most perfect man\\\".[73] Sartre would also compliment Guevara by\\nprofessing that \\\"he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and\\nthe story of the world ran parallel\\\".[74] However he stood against the\\npersecution of gays by Castro's government, which he compared to Nazi\\npersecution of the Jews, and said: \\\"In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are\\nhomosexuals\\\".[75]\\n\\nDuring a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited Red Army Faction\\nmember Andreas Baader in Stammheim Prison and criticized the harsh conditions\\nof imprisonment.[76]\\n\\nTowards the end of his life, Sartre began to describe himself as a \\\"special\\nkind\\\" of anarchist.[77]\\n\\n### Late life and death[edit]\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/2010.05.30.113308_Haus_H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_de_Beauvoir_Goxwiller_FR.jpg/220px-2010.05.30.113308_Haus_H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_de_Beauvoir_Goxwiller_FR.jpg)H\\u00e9l\\u00e8ne\\nde Beauvoir's house in Goxwiller, where Sartre tried to hide from the media\\nafter being awarded the Nobel Prize.\\n\\nIn 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the\\nfirst ten years of his life, _Les Mots_ (_The Words_). The book is an ironic\\ncounterblast to Marcel Proust, whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that\\nof Andr\\u00e9 Gide (who had provided the model of _litt\\u00e9rature engag\\u00e9e_ for\\nSartre's generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a\\nbourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre\\nwas awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but he declined it. He was the first\\nNobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize,[78] and remains one of only\\ntwo laureates to do so.[79] According to Lars Gyllensten, in the book _Minnen,\\nbara minnen_ (\\\"Memories, Only Memories\\\") published in 2000, Sartre himself or\\nsomeone close to him got in touch with the Swedish Academy in 1975 with a\\nrequest for the prize money, but was refused.[80] In 1945, he had refused the\\nL\\u00e9gion d'honneur.[81] The Nobel prize was announced on 22 October 1964; on 14\\nOctober, Sartre had written a letter to the Nobel Institute, asking to be\\nremoved from the list of nominees, and warning that he would not accept the\\nprize if awarded, but the letter went unread;[82] on 23 October, _Le Figaro_\\npublished a statement by Sartre explaining his refusal. He said he did not\\nwish to be \\\"transformed\\\" by such an award, and did not want to take sides in\\nan East vs. West cultural struggle by accepting an award from a prominent\\nWestern cultural institution.[82] Nevertheless, he was that year's\\nprizewinner.[83]\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Jean_Paul_Sartre_1967.1.jpg/220px-\\nJean_Paul_Sartre_1967.1.jpg)Jean-Paul Sartre in Venice in 1967.\\n\\nThough his name was then a household word (as was \\\"existentialism\\\" during the\\ntumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively\\ncommitted to causes until the end of his life, such as the May 1968 strikes in\\nParis during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for civil\\ndisobedience.

Note the Metro tickets left by visitors.\\n\\nIn 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:\\n\\n> I would like [people] to remember _Nausea_ , [my plays] _No Exit_ and _The\\n> Devil and the Good Lord_ , and then my two philosophical works, more\\n> particularly the second one, _Critique of Dialectical Reason_. Then my essay\\n> on Genet, _Saint Genet_. ... If these are remembered, that would be quite an\\n> achievement, and I don't ask for more. As a man, if a certain Jean-Paul\\n> Sartre is remembered, I would like people to remember the milieu or\\n> historical situation in which I lived, ... how I lived in it, in terms of\\n> all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.[85]\\n\\nSartre's physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless\\npace of work (and the use of amphetamine)[86] he put himself through during\\nthe writing of the _Critique_ and a massive analytical biography of Gustave\\nFlaubert (_The Family Idiot_), both of which remained unfinished. He had\\nhypertension,[87] and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a\\nnotorious chain smoker, which could also have contributed to the deterioration\\nof his health.[88]\\n\\nSartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from pulmonary edema. He had not wanted\\nto be buried at P\\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery between his mother and stepfather, so\\nit was arranged that he be buried at Montparnasse Cemetery. At his funeral on\\nSaturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto boulevard du Montparnasse\\nto accompany Sartre's cortege.[89][90] The funeral started at \\\"the hospital at\\n2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre's\\nhaunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar\\nQuinet\\\". Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the\\ncemetery gate.[91] Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at\\nP\\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in\\nMontparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.[92]\\n\\n## Thought[edit]\\n\\nSee also: Being and Nothingness\\n\\nSartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are \\\"condemned to be\\nfree\\\".[93] He explained, \\\"This may seem paradoxical because condemnation is\\nnormally an external judgment which constitutes the conclusion of a judgment.\\nHere, it is not the human who has chosen to be like this. There is a\\ncontingency of human existence. It is a condemnation of their being. Their\\nbeing is not determined, so it is up to everyone to create their own\\nexistence, for which they are then responsible. They cannot not be free, there\\nis a form of necessity for freedom, which can never be given up.\\\"[94]\\n\\nThis theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is\\nillustrated using the example of the paper cutter. Sartre says that if one\\nconsidered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a\\nplan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before\\ntheir existence because there is no Creator. Thus: \\\"existence precedes\\nessence\\\".[93] This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot\\nexplain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human\\nnature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. \\\"We are left\\nalone, without excuse.\\\" \\\"We can act without being determined by our past which\\nis always separated from us.\\\"[95]\\n\\nSartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to\\nbe earned but not learned. We need to experience \\\"death consciousness\\\" so as\\nto wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our\\nlives which is life experience, not knowledge.[96] Death draws the final point\\nwhen we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects\\nthat exist only for the outside world.[97] In this way death emphasizes the\\nburden of our free, individual existence. \\\"We can oppose authenticity to an\\ninauthentic way of being. Authenticity consists in experiencing the\\nindeterminate character of existence in anguish. It is also to know how to\\nface it by giving meaning to our actions and by recognizing ourselves as the\\nauthor of this meaning. On the other hand, an inauthentic way of being\\nconsists in running away, in lying to oneself in order to escape this anguish\\nand the responsibility for one's own existence.\\\"[94]\\n\\nWhile Sartre had been influenced by Heidegger, the publication of _Being and\\nNothingness_ did mark a split in their perspectives, with Heidegger remarking\\nin _Letter on Humanism:_\\n\\n> Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is\\n> taking _existentia_ and _essentia_ according to their metaphysical meaning,\\n> which, from Plato's time on, has said that _essentia_ precedes _existentia_.\\n> Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement\\n> remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in\\n> oblivion of the truth of Being.[98]\\n\\nHerbert Marcuse also had issues with Sartre's metaphysical interpretation of\\nhuman existence in _Being and Nothingness_ and suggested the work projected\\nanxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself:\\n\\n> Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an\\n> idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human\\n> existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism\\n> thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism\\n> is illusory.[99]\\n\\nSartre also took inspiration from phenomenological epistemology, explained by\\nFranz Adler in this way: \\\"Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action\\nimplies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the\\nactor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances.\\\"[100] Also\\nimportant is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his\\nsuggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that\\nthe conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for\\nSartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to\\ndesires as well as to perceptions.[101] \\\"When an external object is perceived,\\nconsciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its\\nown object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself.\\\"[102] However his\\ncritique of psychoanalysis, particularly of Freud has faced some counter-\\ncritique. Richard Wollheim and Thomas Baldwin argued that Sartre's attempt to\\nshow that Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a\\nmisinterpretation of Freud.[103][104]\\n\\n## Career as public intellectual[edit]\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Sartre_and_de_Beauvoir_at_Balzac_Memorial.jpg/170px-\\nSartre_and_de_Beauvoir_at_Balzac_Memorial.jpg)Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de\\nBeauvoir at the Balzac Memorial.\\n\\nWhile the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human\\nfreedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public\\nmatters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944\\u20131945.[105] Before\\nWorld War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal\\nintellectual: \\\"Now teaching at a lyc\\u00e9e in Laon ... Sartre made his\\nheadquarters the Dome caf\\u00e9 at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail\\nboulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined [with] women. He wrote.\\nAnd he was published.\\\"[106] Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir,\\nexisted, in her words, where \\\"the world about us was a mere backdrop against\\nwhich our private lives were played out\\\".[107]\\n\\nThe war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood\\nuntil forced into continual engagement with it: \\\"the world itself destroyed\\nSartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear\\nhis own personal stake in the events of the time.\\\"[108] Returning to Paris in\\n1941, he formed the \\\"Socialisme et Libert\\u00e9\\\" resistance group. In 1943, after\\nthe group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group,[109] in which\\nhe remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to\\nwrite ferociously, and it was due to this \\\"crucial experience of war and\\ncaptivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to\\nexpress it through literature\\\".[110]\\n\\nThe symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the\\nintroduction he wrote for a new journal, _Les Temps modernes_ , in October\\n1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called\\nfor writers to express their political commitment.[111] Yet, this alignment\\nwas indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party\\nof the Left.\\n\\nSartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a public intellectual. He\\nenvisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor\\ndefinitely finished; instead, in true existential fashion, \\\"culture was always\\nconceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention.\\\" This marks\\nSartre, the intellectual, as a pragmatist, willing to move and shift stance\\nalong with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the\\nbelief in human freedom, preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is\\nthis overarching theme of freedom that means his work \\\"subverts the bases for\\ndistinctions among the disciplines\\\".[112] Therefore, he was able to hold\\nknowledge across a vast array of subjects: \\\"the international world order, the\\npolitical and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially\\nFrance, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of\\nordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and\\ndisseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about\\nwhat he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world.\\\"[113]\\n\\nSartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the French Communist\\nParty (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the\\nLiberation the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to\\nlure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into\\nSartre's own existentialism.[114] From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims\\nof the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its\\n\\\"authoritarian tendencies\\\". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the Maoists, a\\nmovement that rejected the authority of established communist parties.[1]\\nHowever, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events:\\n\\\"If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed\\nprofoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist.\\\"[115] He would later\\nexplicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.[116][117]\\n\\nIn the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre\\nin political matters, he set forth a body of work which \\\"reflected on\\nvirtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore\\nalternative solutions to the problems posed there\\\".[118] The greatest\\ndifficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the\\nincreasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed\\nword as a form of expression. In Sartre's opinion, the \\\"traditional bourgeois\\nliterary forms remain innately superior\\\", but there is \\\"a recognition that the\\nnew technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced\\\" if Sartre's ethical and\\npolitical goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved:\\nthe demystification of bourgeois political practices and the raising of the\\nconsciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.[119]\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/President_Nasser-\\nSagan-Sartre.jpg/220px-President_Nasser-Sagan-Sartre.jpg)Sartre, Simone de\\nBeauvoir and Claude Lanzmann meeting President Gamal Abdel Nasser at his home\\nin Cairo, February 1967.\\n\\nThe struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning\\nto take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts\\nto reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers\\nhe had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some\\nof these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media,\\nadvertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice\\nversa.[120]\\n\\nSartre's role as a public intellectual occasionally put him in physical\\ndanger, such as in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of\\nhis apartment building. His public support of Algerian self-determination at\\nthe time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that\\nmounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took\\nplace the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from Oran,\\nAlgeria.[121]\\n\\nSartre's role in this conflict included his comments in his preface to Frantz\\nFanon's _The Wretched of the Earth_ that, \\\"To shoot down a European is to kill\\ntwo birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at\\nthe same time: there remains a dead man and a free man\\\". This comment led to\\nsome criticisms from the right, such as by Brian C. Anderson and Michael\\nWalzer. Writing for the Hoover Institution, Walzer suggested that Sartre, a\\nEuropean, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.[122][123]\\n\\nHowever Sartre's stances regarding post-colonial conflict have not been\\nentirely without controversy on the left; Sartre's preface is omitted from\\nsome editions of _The Wretched of the Earth_ printed after 1967. The reason\\nfor this is for his public support for Israel in the Six-Day War. Fanon's\\nwidow, Josie considered Sartre's pro-Israel stance as inconsistent with the\\nanti-colonialist position of the book, from which his preface was eventually\\nomitted.[124] When interviewed at Howard University in 1978, she explained\\n\\\"when Israel declared war on the Arab countries [during the Six-Day War],\\nthere was a great pro-Zionist movement in favor of Israel among western\\n(French) intellectuals. Sartre took part in this movement. He signed petitions\\nfavoring Israel. I felt that his pro-Zionist attitudes were incompatible with\\nFanon's work\\\".[124] Recent reprints of Fanon's book have generally included\\nSartre's preface.\\n\\n## Literature[edit]\\n\\nSartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major\\ncontributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are\\nrichly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-\\nknown, _Huis-clos_ (_No Exit_), contains the famous line \\\"L'enfer, c'est les\\nautres\\\", usually translated as \\\"Hell is other people.\\\"[125] Aside from the\\nimpact of _Nausea_ , Sartre's major work of fiction was _The Roads to Freedom_\\ntrilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's\\nideas. In this way, _Roads to Freedom_ presents a less theoretical and more\\npractical approach to existentialism.\\n\\nJohn Huston got Sartre to script his film _Freud: The Secret Passion_.[126]\\nHowever it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's\\ncredits.[127] Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre's script survive in\\nthe finished film.[126]\\n\\nDespite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and\\nplaywrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively,\\nto that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Church\\nplaced Sartre's _\\u0153uvre_ on the _Index Librorum Prohibitorum_ (List of\\nProhibited Books).\\n\\n## Allegations of sexual abuse[edit]\\n\\nIn 1993, French author Bianca Lamblin (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in\\nher book  _M\\u00e9moires d'une jeune fille d\\u00e9rang\\u00e9e_ (Memoirs of a deranged girl,\\npublished in English under the title  _A Disgraceful Affair_) of her sexual\\nexploitation by Sartre and Beauvoir.[128] Lamblin claims that, while a student\\nat Lyc\\u00e9e Moli\\u00e8re, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who\\nintroduced her to Sartre a year later. Bianca wrote her  _M\\u00e9moires_ in\\nresponse to the posthumous 1990 publication of Jean-Paul Sartre's  _Lettres au\\nCastor et \\u00e0 quelques autres: 1926-1963_ (Letters to Castor and other friends),\\nin which she noted that she was referred to by the pseudonym Louise\\nV\\u00e9drine.[129]\\n\\nSartre and Beauvoir frequently followed this pattern, in which Beauvoir would\\nseduce students and then pass them on to Sartre.[130][131][132][133]\\n\\n## Works[edit]\\n\\n### Novels and Short Story Collection[edit]\\n\\n  * _Nausea_ / _La naus\\u00e9e_ (1938)\\n  * _The Wall_ / _Le mur_ (1939) \\u2013 collection of 5 short stories\\n\\n#### _The Roads to Freedom_[edit]\\n\\n  1. _The Age of Reason_ / _L'\\u00e2ge de raison_ (1945)\\n  2. _The Reprieve_ / _Le sursis_ (1945)\\n  3. _Troubled Sleep_ (London ed.
